Description
===========

This package provides an Python implementation of the ElPiGraph algorithm. A
self-contained description of the algorithm is available
[here](https://github.com/auranic/Elastic-principal-graphs/blob/master/ElPiGraph_Methods.pdf)
or on this [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07580)

A [R implementation](https://github.com/Albluca/ElPiGraph.R) of this algorithm is also available,
coded by [Luca Albergante](https://github.com/Albluca)

A native MATLAB implementation of the algorithm (coded by [Andrei
Zinovyev](https://github.com/auranic/) and [Evgeny
Mirkes](https://github.com/Mirkes)) is also
[available](https://github.com/auranic/Elastic-principal-graphs)
